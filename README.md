AMAImageSearch
========================

This is a sample project I created for a small iOS development introduction at our company. It demonstrates **UICollectionViews**, makes use of **AFNetworking** and parses **JSON** to display images from the web.

Furthermore, the collection view uses **CHTCollectionViewWaterfallLayout** to get a Pinterest-style view layout.

## Cocoapods

The project uses the awesome [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) to fetch the dependencies. Simply run `pod install` to set up the project. The project uses the following pods:

* [AFNetworking 2](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)
* [MBProgressHUD](https://github.com/jdg/MBProgressHUD)
* [CHTCollectionViewWaterfallLayout](https://github.com/chiahsien/CHTCollectionViewWaterfallLayout)


## HTTP Clients

* **Instagram** image search
 	* 	Provide your own *Client ID* from your instagram (developer) account.

* **Bing** image search
	*	Provide your Bing application *Client secret* to use the search.
* **Unsplash** image listing from Tumblr
	*	Provide your Tumblr *API key* to use the listing.

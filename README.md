AMAImageSearch
========================

This is a sample project I created for a small iOS development introduction at our company. It demonstrates **tableviews**, makes use of **AFNetworking** and parses **JSON** to display images from the web.

I have implemented to HTTP clients:

* **Instagram** image search
	* 	You need to provide your own *Client ID* from your instagram (developer) account to use this. 
* **Google Image Search**, the deprectated API though. It is simply much simpler and more convient to use.
